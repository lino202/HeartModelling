# Explanation and Usage

The code in this folder enables the creation of the ventricular conduction system, fiber orientation, and Laplacian fields used to define transmural heterogeneity.
These scripts are intended to be used in combination with others located outside this folder — for example, after mesh tetrahedralization with s3_genTetraMeshSurface.m and before generating the actual transmural heterogeneity with s5_perrottiEndoMidEpi.py.
